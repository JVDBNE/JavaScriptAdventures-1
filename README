# Adventures into JavaScript

This Repo will continue to grow as a dive deeper into foundational concepts within JavaScript and build my understanding. 


**GEOMETRY**
JS Practice exercises via Treehouse Tech and first introduction to Maths concepts in JS.
Volume and Area of a range of shapes. 


**ARRAYS**
basic arrays, loops and Creating/shuffling a Deck of cards practice via Treehouse Tech. 


**ARROW FUNCTIONS**
introduction to converting standard functions, debugging and refactoring. FUN!


**LOOPS**
FOR EACH - Array iteration methods. 

IFELSE - it was great to introduce the pipe operator which I had only previously seen in Elixir and once again understand how utilising it cleans code up really well! 


**OBJECTS**

Basic Objects
Object Literals 
Template Literals. 


I really enjoyed these exercises and by the end of the challenges felt that arrow functions and how I can refactor my code started to really click! 
At a beginner level it is finding a balance between refactoring and condensing and also ensuring that I understand where I have pulled a variable from 
(especially if it has been eliminated in replace of an arrow function etc)
